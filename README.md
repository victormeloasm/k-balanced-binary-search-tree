Certainly! Below is a sample README.md file for a GitHub repository explaining the k-balanced binary search tree implementation in C:

# K-Balanced Binary Search Tree in C

This repository contains a C implementation of a k-balanced binary search tree. A k-balanced binary search tree is a data structure where the heights of any two sibling subtrees differ by at most a factor of k.

## Features

- Insertion of elements while maintaining the k-balanced property
- Deletion of elements while ensuring the tree remains k-balanced
- Updating the value of a node in the tree while preserving the balance
- Checking if a tree is k-balanced
- Inorder traversal of the tree

## Usage

To use this implementation, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k-balanced-binary-search-tree.git
```

2. Compile the C file:

```
gcc k_balanced_bst.c -o k_balanced_bst
```

3. Run the executable:

```
./k_balanced_bst
```

## API

### `Node* insert(Node* root, int data)`

Inserts a new node with the given data into the k-balanced binary search tree.

### `Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int data)`

Deletes the node with the specified data from the k-balanced binary search tree.

### `Node* update(Node* root, int oldData, int newData)`

Updates the value of a node with `oldData` to `newData` while maintaining the balance of the tree.

### `int isKBalanced(Node* root, int k)`

Checks if the k-balanced binary search tree is k-balanced.

### `void inorder(Node* root)`

Performs an inorder traversal of the k-balanced binary search tree.
